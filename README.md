## Introduction: 
In this project, data scraped from a website called Goodreads is used to build a linear regression model to solve a useful prediction problem. Goodreads is an American social cataloging website and a subsidiary of Amazon that allows individuals to search its database of books, annotations, quotes, and reviews and generate library catalogs and reading lists. Book finder is a website that poeple use it ti search for books prices.
We will be building a model to predict book prices and we will explore the effect of diffrent features on the prices. 

## Methodology 

The methodology followed for this project execution is as follows: 
1)	Collecting the dataset
2)	Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
3)	Linear regression


## Data Description:
Web scraping skills will be employed for collection of book data from Goodreads, such as title, genre, ISBN, rating, number of reviews, number of pages. Additionally, price points for books will be fetched from Amazon. And then the ISBN will be used to scrape Book Finder to get the prices of books.


## Tools
- beautiful soup and selenium in python (Scraping the web)
- Pandas and Numpy (Exploring the data)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (Visualizing the data)
- Sci-kit Learn (linear Regression model)

Other tools may be used during the execution of the data analysis


## MVP goal 
this project will be delivered at the end of week 2 as a project 1 for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, the project will include the following :
    
-  Final file code
-  The scraped dataset
-  Presentation explaining the summary of the project
