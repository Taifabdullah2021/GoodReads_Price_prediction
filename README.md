## Introduction: 
In this project, data scraped from a website called Goodreads is used to build a linear regression model to solve a useful prediction problem. Goodreads is an American social cataloging website and a subsidiary of Amazon that allows individuals to search its database of books, annotations, quotes, and reviews and generate library catalogs and reading lists. 

## Methodology 

The methodology followed for this project execution is as follows: 
1)	Collecting the dataset
2)	Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
3)	Linear regression
 
## Question/need:
This project will be useful for authors wishing to publish new books and study the market well to make sure they get the highest ratings depending on the set of features mentioned in the next section. 
- For each genre, what are the most impactful features that ensure high ratings?
- What would be the perfect price range for a book of a certain genre and page count? 
- How does price affect ratings, given other metrics of book popularity?

## Data Description:
Web scraping skills will be employed for collection of book data from Goodreads, such as title, genre, ISBN, rating, number of reviews, number of pages. Additionally, price points for books will be fetched from Amazon. 


## Tools
- beautiful soup and selenium in python (Scraping the web)
- Pandas and Numpy (Exploring the data)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (Visualizing the data)
- Sci-kit Learn (linear Regression model)

Other tools may be used during the execution of the data analysis


## MVP goal 
this project will be delivered at the end of week 2 as a project 1 for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, the project will include the following :
    
-  Final file code
-  The scraped dataset
-  Presentation explaining the summary of the project
